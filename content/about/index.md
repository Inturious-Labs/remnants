**Remnants of Globalization** is a collection of stories of the men and women who rode the wave of globalization and enjoyed its full visceral impact.

We were made in that era and still carry its mark. It was an age of youthful innocence and blissful ignorance. We boarded the USS Enterprise to explore the boundary of the galaxy to infinity and beyond. Some of us have found Arrakis to settle down, and many of us are still searching for the Terminus.

The series is a feeble attempt to answer some questions on what got us this far, though in doing so, it inevitably raises even more questions—where do we go from here?

## Disclaimer

This is a work of fiction. Unless otherwise indicated, all the names, characters, businesses, places, events, and incidents in this series are either the product of the author's imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincidental.

The goofy names for the characters come from the lore of J.R.R. Tolkien—a tongue-in-cheek reminder that it would be meaningless to pinpoint the characters to real-life personalities.
